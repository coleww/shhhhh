synth-maker
--------------

- generate a synth
- randomize css somehow (colors, grid, etc. )
- random audio for loops
- texture imgs for backgrounds....gradients...
- bind keys to stuff (standard piano notes + ???)
- random name for the synth
- OMG USE THE NAME OF THE SYNTH AS THE RANDOMNESS SEED WTF WOW
- random useless names for paramaters sometimes?
- use a seeded random so it's retrievable? update the url query
- DEFAULT key bindy thing. like, piano keys, and random buttons that modify stuff.
   I II III IV V etc. not actual keys. 
   also add random styles to these
- maybe it sometimes has a sequencer thing? 
- fx packages? (how 2 build controls?) (make web-audio-ui less dumb, then its easy. each file in that src now should just be a like makeElementDude with config set)
- motion controls
- query string to set key, bpm, etc. robot to have it randomly click stuff
- use loops instead of oscillators.

functions that take an RNG and spit out random bits of instrument.
